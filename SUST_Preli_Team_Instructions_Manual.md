Team Instructions Manual

Read this ﬁrst

This  manual  explains  how  to execute the preliminary round: read the problem, divide work, build the API,
test it, deploy it, and submit the required deliverables. It should be read together with the Problem Statement
and the Evaluation Rubric.

1. Participant Document Pack

Document

Purpose

Problem Statement

Deﬁnes the challenge, input/output schema, and
required behavior.

What it answers

What do we need to build?

Evaluation Rubric

Explains scoring categories, safety penalties, hidden
tests, and tie-breakers.

How will we be judged?

Team Instructions
Manual

Explains build ﬂow, deployment options, secrets
policy, testing, and submission.

How do we execute and
submit?

2. What Teams Need to Build

Required item

Instruction

API service

Build a backend service for QueueStorm Investigator.

GET /health

Must return {"status":"ok"}. This proves the service is running.

POST /analyze-ticket  Main endpoint. It must accept the problem statement input JSON and return the

required structured output JSON.

Valid JSON response  Use the exact required ﬁeld names, types, and enum values from the problem

statement.

README.md

Explain setup, run command, AI/model usage, safety logic, and known limitations.

Frontend/UI is optional

A frontend or UI is not required for the preliminary round and will not be directly judged. Prioritize API
correctness, evidence reasoning, safety, reliability, deployment, and documentation.

3. Available Resources

Resource

How teams may use it

Poridhi Labs

Use the provided lab environment for coding, testing, and deployment support.

Poridhi VM

Deploy the API service manually on a VM if provided.

Team Instructions Manual : Codex Community Hackathon

3

Resource

How teams may use it

AWS through Poridhi
Labs

Deploy using AWS resources available through Poridhi Labs, such as EC2 or similar
environments.

Puku Editor/CLI

Use for AI-assisted coding, debugging, project setup, refactoring, and documentation.

Any other platform

Teams may also deploy on Render, Railway, Fly.io, Vercel, AWS EC2, or any other
reachable hosting platform.

Resource policy

Poridhi resources are provided as support, not as a restriction. Teams may deploy anywhere they want as
long as the submitted API is reachable and judgeable.

4. Suggested Team Role Split

Role

Main responsibility

API/Backend Lead

Build endpoints, request parsing, response formatting, validation, and deployment
setup.

Reasoning/Logic Lead

Implement transaction matching, evidence verdict, case classiﬁcation, routing, and
severity.

AI/Safety/Docs Lead

Integrate LLM/rules/local model if used, add safety guardrails, test edge cases, and
write README.

For solo teams: follow the same order - schema ﬁrst, reasoning second, safety third, deployment last.

5. API Submission Rule

The judge should be able to call the following endpoints from the submitted base URL:

GET  https://your-service-url.com/health
POST https://your-service-url.com/analyze-ticket

●  No login, dashboard access, manual approval, or private network access should be required for the

judge.

●  The service must accept JSON input and return JSON output.
●  Use the exact endpoint names from the problem statement.
●  The service should remain reachable during the evaluation window.

6.  Deployment Options

Priority  Submission path

What to submit

Notes

1

Working endpoint URL  Public base URL and GitHub

repository.

Preferred path. Judges call the API
directly.

Team Instructions Manual : Codex Community Hackathon

3

Lightweight Docker
fallback

Dockerﬁle or image details,
dependency ﬁles, and run
command.

Code-only
reproducibility

GitHub repo with complete
setup/run documentation.

Accepted if public deployment is
not possible.

Last fallback. May receive reduced
deployment/reproducibility credit if
hard to run.

7. Deploying on Poridhi Lab / VM / AWS

●  Create the project repository and conﬁrm that the API runs locally ﬁrst.
●  Use Poridhi Lab, Poridhi VM, or AWS through Poridhi Labs if provided to your team.
●  Install dependencies on the VM or selected environment.
●  Set required environment variables in the runtime environment, not in the repository.
●  Run the service on the documented port and bind it to 0.0.0.0.
●  Expose the service using the platform URL, VM public IP, reverse proxy, or any provided deployment

mechanism. (Poridhi Labs Documentation is also provided to the teams)

●  Test /health and /analyze-ticket from outside the environment before submitting.

8. Docker Fallback Rules

Rule

Requirement

Recommended image size

Under 500MB.

Hard image size limit

1GB.

GPU

Not allowed.

Large local model weights

Not allowed.

Multi-GB downloads during
evaluation

Not allowed.

Runtime training

Not allowed.

Port binding

Must bind to 0.0.0.0.

Health readiness

/health must respond within 60 seconds of service start.

Secrets

Must be passed through environment variables only. Do not bake secrets
into the image.

9. AI and Model Usage Policy

Allowed approach

Status

Rule-based logic

External AI APIs

Allowed and encouraged. The task is designed to be solvable without paid
APIs.

Allowed using the team's own account and keys. Organizers will not
provide third-party API keys.

Lightweight local models

Allowed if they run without GPU and ﬁt within runtime/image limits.

Hybrid rule + AI system

Huge local LLMs / GPU
dependency

Recommended. Use rules for evidence/safety and AI for language
understanding or drafting.

Not allowed for preliminary judging.

Third-party API responsibility

If a team uses OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Google AI, or any other external API, the team is
responsible for API keys, cost, quota, rate limits, and availability during evaluation.

10. Secrets and Environment Variables

Important security rule

Do not commit real secrets to GitHub, even if the repository is private. Do not put secrets in README,
screenshots, Docker images, commit history, or public messages.

Where

What should be placed there

GitHub repository

Source code, README, dependency ﬁles, Dockerﬁle if needed, and
.env.example only. No real secrets.

.env.example

Variable names only. Example values should be placeholders.

Hosting platform

Real secrets for deployed endpoint submissions. Example:
Render/Railway/Fly/Vercel/EC2/Poridhi Lab environment variables.

Submission form private ﬁeld

Real secrets only if Docker/code fallback requires them for judging. This
ﬁeld should be visible only to technical judges.

Repository example:

OPENAI_API_KEY=
MODEL_NAME=
PORT=8000

Private judging secret example, only if required for Docker/code fallback:

Team Instructions Manual : Codex Community Hackathon

6

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_real_temporary_key
MODEL_NAME=your_model_name
PORT=8000

●  Teams should use temporary, limited-quota keys when sharing secrets for judging.
●  Teams should revoke or rotate shared keys after evaluation is complete.
●  Organizers will not provide third-party API keys for this round.
●  If a Docker/code fallback depends on private secrets that are not provided, judges may not be able to

run it fully and the team may lose deployment/reproducibility or functionality points.

11. Repository Access Policy

Repository type

Requirement

Public repository

Submit the repository URL in the form.

Private repository

Add the organizer GitHub handle(s) before the deadline with read access.

Repository availability

The repository must remain accessible to organizers until preliminary results
are published.

After results

Teams may delete, archive, or make the repository private after preliminary
results are published.

Secrets

The repository must not contain real secrets at any time.

12. Testing Checklist Before Submission

Check

14. What Not to Do

Mention rules, local model, external API, or hybrid
approach.

Explain OTP/PIN/refund/reversal safeguards.

Be honest about edge cases and failure modes.

Only synthetic data should be used.

Checkbox or written conﬁrmation.

Do not

Why

Do not build only a UI or screenshots

The preliminary round judges the API.

Do not submit an endpoint that requires login

The judge harness must call it directly.

Do not use real customer or payment data

Privacy and safety issue. Use only synthetic data.

Do not integrate real payment APIs

Out of scope for the preliminary round.

Do not ask users for OTP, PIN, password, or
secret credentials

Do not promise refunds, reversals, account
unblocks, or recovery

Critical ﬁntech safety violation.

The system is a support copilot, not an authority.

Team Instructions Manual : Codex Community Hackathon

Do not

Why

Do not commit API keys or .env ﬁles

Security risk and bad engineering practice.

Do not rely on huge models, GPU, or multi-GB
downloads

Not judgeable at scale.

15. Common Troubleshooting

Problem

What to check

404 on /health or /analyze-ticket

Conﬁrm exact route names and base URL.

Invalid JSON response

Schema error

Timeout

External API failure

Docker runs locally but not for judges

Return application/json and avoid printing extra logs in the
response body.

Check required ﬁelds, data types, enum spelling, and null
handling.

Reduce model calls, add fallback logic, cache where safe,
and avoid large downloads.

Handle quota/rate-limit errors safely and return a controlled
response.

Bind to 0.0.0.0, expose the correct port, and document the
run command.

Private repo inaccessible

Add organizer GitHub handle(s) before the deadline.

Missing secrets

Use hosting env vars for deployed endpoint or private
submission ﬁeld for Docker/code fallback.

16. Final Pre-Submit Checklist
●  Problem statement read and implementation aligned with the required schema.
●  GET /health and POST /analyze-ticket tested successfully.
●  Safety guardrails tested against OTP/PIN/refund/reversal cases.
●  Endpoint deployed or Docker/code fallback prepared.
●  GitHub repository accessible to organizers.
●  README includes setup, run command, sample request, sample response, AI/model usage, safety

logic, and limitations.
.env.example added if environment variables are needed.

●
●  No real secrets committed to the repository.
●  Required private secrets submitted only through the oﬃcial private ﬁeld if needed for judging.
●  Submission form completed before the deadline.

Final advice

Build the API ﬁrst. Make the schema correct. Add evidence and reasoning. Add safety guardrails. Test it.
Deploy it. Submit clearly. A simple, reliable, safe API will score better than a ﬂashy but broken product.
