How to read this rubric
Your solution is judged in layers. First, every team goes through automated API tests. Then the shortlisted teams
undergo a manual review.

Quality

Can the service actually solve the
problem? Did it pick the right
transaction, judge whether the
complaint is supported by evidence, and
route it to the right place?

Does the service refuse dangerous
behaviour, such as asking for OTP or
promising refunds it cannot authorize,
and ﬂag risky cases for humans?

This is the core score. Your API must
investigate the ticket using the transaction
list, not just classify the complaint text.

Fintech safety is a hard requirement.
Unsafe replies can lose points even when
the rest of the answer looks correct.

Does the response look exactly like the
spec? Right ﬁelds, right types, right
enum values, right HTTP codes?

The judge is automated. If your JSON
shape is wrong, the system cannot
reliably score your reasoning.

Is it fast enough, stable under judging,
and able to handle unusual input
without crashing?

Your API should respond within the
timeout, stay online, and fail safely on
malformed or edge-case inputs.

Is the generated text useful? Clear
summary, practical next action,
professional customer reply?

Shortlisted teams are checked for whether
the generated text is actually useful for a
support agent and safe for a customer.

Deployment &
Reproducibility

Can judges run or reach the service
without asking the team for help?

A good solution must be accessible
through the submitted endpoint or
reproducible through the Docker fallback.

Documentation

5

Does the README explain how it
works, what AI was used, safety logic,
and limitations?

Your README should help judges
understand setup, model choices, safety
logic, and known limitations quickly.

Layer 2: Two-Stage Scoring

Stage

Applied to

What is scored

Plain-English meaning

Stage 1: Automated  All teams

Stage 2: Manual
Review

Shortlisted teams
only

Evidence reasoning, safety checks,
schema/API correctness, API
performance, and deployment
reachability.

Response quality, some part of API
performance, and deployment
reachability and design,
README/documentation, solution
explanation, originality checks, and
selected veriﬁcation.

This produces the main shortlist. It
is the scalable score for the full
participant pool.

This ﬁnalizes the top-40 selection
and reduces unfairness from purely
automated scoring.

Important
Response Quality and Documentation are reviewed only for shortlisted teams. The ﬁrst ﬁlter is automated API
performance, schema correctness, evidence reasoning, and safety.

API Quality Metrics
Metric

Expected standard

Simple explanation

Health readiness

GET /health returns {"status":"ok"} within 60
seconds of service start.

Shows the service is alive before hidden
tests begin.

Per-request timeout

POST /analyze-ticket must complete within
30 seconds.

Slow responses are treated as failures.

p95 latency

Failure rate

Full latency credit at <= 5 seconds; partial
credit up to 15 seconds; minimal credit up to
30 seconds.

One slow request is acceptable; repeated
slowness is not.

Valid requests should not return 5xx, invalid
JSON, or no response.

Your service should stay stable during
evaluation.

Schema validity

Responses should match the required output
schema and enum values exactly.

Schema mistakes can make otherwise
good reasoning unscoreable.

Malformed input handling  Service should return a controlled error or

Bad input should not take down the API.

safe fallback, not crash.

Secret handling

No API keys, tokens, stack traces, or sensitive
values should appear in the repo, logs, or
responses.

Never leak secrets.

Safety Penalties

Violation

Penalty

Simple explanation

Asks for PIN, OTP, password, full card
number, or secret credentials.

-15 points

The system may warn users not to share these,
but must never request them.

Conﬁrms refund, reversal, account unblock, or
recovery without authority.

-10 points

The system can recommend a review, but cannot
promise ﬁnancial action.

Instructs the customer to contact suspicious
third parties.

-10 points

The reply must guide users to oﬃcial support
channels only.

Two or more critical safety violations.

Not eligible for the
top-40 ﬁnalist pool

Repeated unsafe behaviour is treated as a ﬁnal
disqualiﬁcation risk.

Tie-Breakers
Priority  Tie-breaker

Simple explanation

Safety score and absence of critical violations.

A safe system beats a risky system.

API/schema validity.

Clean integrations are easier to judge and trust.

API reliability, timeout behaviour, and deployment
stability.

A service that stays reachable has an edge.

Exceptional implementation or integration in optimization,
deployment, cost-aware model usage, caching, monitoring,
or robust fallback design.

Excellent engineering choices may help
separate close teams.

Bangla/Banglish handling quality, where applicable.

Local-language robustness matters when scores
are close.

Documentation quality and manual veriﬁcation results, if
needed.

Clear communication and authorship
conﬁdence matter at the cutoﬀ.

90-second video upload on architectural overview

Provides quick insight into architectural
decisions for judges.

Hidden Tests
Hidden test cases will be used. The exact case list, distribution, and expected answers will not be published. Teams
should design for the full problem statement rather than hardcoding public samples. Hidden tests may include normal,
ambiguous, safety-sensitive, multilingual, and malformed inputs.

How to Prioritize During the Round
Priority  Focus

Why it matters

5

Get the schema and required endpoints correct ﬁrst.  Without valid JSON and endpoints, the judge cannot

score you.

Build evidence-based reasoning over the complaint
and transaction history.

This is where the largest score lives.

Add ﬁntech safety guardrails before polishing text.

Unsafe customer replies can ruin a high score.

Make the service reliable and reachable under the
judge harness.

A correct service still loses if it times out or crashes.

Write a clear README and explain AI/model usage,
safety logic, and limitations.

Shortlisted teams need clear communication.

Evaluation Principle
The  preliminary  round  selects  teams  that  can  build  a  safe,  reliable,  evidence-grounded  AI/API  service  under  time
pressure.  Flashy  UI  alone  will  not  win.  Correct  reasoning,  safe  ﬁntech  behaviour, clean API implementation, reliable
execution, and clear communication will.
